Hey,

Just a quick note about my coding project. It's my first time working on something this big, and as a beginner, I apologize if there are any mistakes along the way. I'm working on a task/todo manager in the terminal using the curses module.
Working with curses has been challenging but exciting. Taking on a project of this scale has been a significant undertaking, but I'm proud of myself for diving in headfirst. It's taught me so much about managing complex systems and organizing tasks.
There's still work to be done, but I wanted to take a moment to celebrate the progress I've made. I might revisit this project again later but not now.

Cheers
